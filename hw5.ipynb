    "### Different RNN Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a different RNN architecture called a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Why is an LSTM better than a standard RNN? The hidden state can be thought of as a \"memory\" of the words seen by the model. It is difficult to train a standard RNN as the gradient decays exponentially along the sequence, causing the RNN to \"forget\" what has happened earlier in the sequence. LSTMs have an extra recurrent state called a _cell_, which can be thought of as the \"memory\" of the LSTM and can remember information for many time steps. LSTMs also use multiple _gates_, these control the flow of information into and out of the memory. For more information, go [here](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bidirectional RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind a bidirectional RNN is simple. As well as having an RNN processing the words in the sentence from the first to the last, we have a second RNN processing the words in the sentence from the **last to the first**. PyTorch simplifies this by concatenating both the forward and backward RNNs together, and thus the returned final hidden state, `hidden`, is the concatenation of the hidden state from the last word of the sentence from the forward RNN with the hidden state of the first word of the sentence from the backward RNN, both of which are the final hidden states from their respective RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/itmIIgx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-layer RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-layer RNNs (also called *deep RNNs*) are another simple concept. The idea is that we add additional RNNs on top of the initial standard RNN, where each RNN added is another *layer*. The hidden state output by the first (bottom) RNN at time-step $t$ will be the input to the RNN above it at time step $t$. The prediction is then usually made from the final hidden state of the final (highest) layer. These are easily combined with bi-directional RNNs, where each extra layer adds an additional forward and backward RNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/knsIzeh.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we've added improvements to our model, each one adds additional parameters. Without going into overfitting into to much detail, the more parameters you have in in your model, the higher the probability that you'll overfit (have a low train error but high validation/test error). To combat this, we use regularization. More specifically, we use a method of regularization called *dropout*. Dropout works by randomly *dropping out* (setting to 0) neurons during a forward pass. The probability that each neuron is dropped out is set by a hyperparameter and each neuron with dropout applied is considered indepenently. One theory about why dropout works is that a model with parameters dropped out can be seen as a \"weaker\" (less parameters) model, the predictions from all these \"weaker\" models (one for each forward pass) get averaged together in the parameters of the model. Thus, your one model can be thought of as an ensemble of weaker models, none of which are over-parameterized and thus should not overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an LSTM instead of the standard RNN, we use `nn.LSTM` instead of `nn.RNN` on line 8. Also note on line 20 the LSTM returns the `output` and a tuple of the final `hidden` state and the final `cell` state, whereas the standard RNN only returned the `output` and final `hidden` state. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the final hidden state of our LSTM has both a forward and a backward component, which are concatenated together, the size of the input to the `nn.Linear` layer is twice that of the hidden dimension size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing bidirectionality and adding additional layers are done by passing values for the `num_layers` and `bidirectional` arguments for the RNN/LSTM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is implemented by initializing an `nn.Dropout` layer (the argument is the probability of dropout for each neuron) and using it within the `forward` method after each layer we want to apply dropout to. **Note**: never use dropout on the input or output layers (`x` or `fc` in this case), you only ever want to use dropout on intermediate layers. The LSTM has a `dropout` argument which adds dropout on the connections between hidden states in one layer to hidden states in the next layer.  "
